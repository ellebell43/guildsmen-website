      <h1>Establishments</h1>
      <p>Establishments are public institutions or business organizations. They can be anywhere from the size of a
        tavern to the size of a large country’s government. Whatever your establishment is and what its goals are,
        are completely up to you. This mechanic has very little dice rolling and is based heavily in roleplay.</p>

      <p>Before we dive in, it’s important to understand that this mechanic is something that could easily become the
        focus of play. Before trying to use it, make sure everyone at the table is interested and wants to try it.
        It's easy to start up and play with.</p>

      <p>When players appear to start building or taking over an Establishment, the Game Master will be
        able to quickly fill out an Establishment Sheet to help them gauge how the player’ establishment is doing,
        as well as keep track of a few other rival establishments.</p>

      </div>

      <section id="stats">
        <h2>Stats</h2>
        <p>Stats are the most important aspects of your Establishment. They outline 6 attributes that detail how well
          your Establishment is functioning: Health, Innovation, Might, Morale, Order, and Wealth</p>

        <p>How well these stats are doing is represented by a word to give a narrative tool for the GM. They can range
          anywhere from Poor to Exquisite.</p>

        <p><strong>Health</strong> is very straightforward. It represents the health of your Establishment. This can be
          interpreted as cleanliness and a lack of disease. In the context of a simple tavern, a higher health score
          would represent a very clean tavern with no rodents or dust. In the context of a city, a higher health score
          would mean quality city sanitation and low disease rates.</p>

        <p><strong>Innovation</strong> represents how creative, original, and advanced your Establishment is versus
          rival Establishments. This can be interpreted as your level of technology or your originality that draws
          people to your Establishments instead of your competitors. In the context of a tavern, a higher Innovation
          score would represent higher quality entertainment and drinks, private rooms, and luxurious suites that are
          better than your competitors. In the context of a city, a higher Innovation score would represent a higher
          level of technology, quality of education, and original civil projects that the people support.</p>

        <p><strong>Might</strong> represents how strong your Establishment is compared to others. This can be
          interpreted as more troops, technologically superior weapons, or blackmail material against your
          competitors. In the context of a tavern, a higher Might score would represents more bouncers, bouncers that
          are more intimidating, or some information you can hold over the heads of your competitors. In the context
          of a city, a higher Might score would represent a better policing force or militia, higher political power
          than other cities, or access to powerful allies.</p>

        <p><strong>Morale</strong> represents the happiness and motivation of the people under your Establishment. This
          can be interpreted as how well your people get along with each other and how happy your people are in
          general. In the context of a tavern, a higher Morale score would represent how well behaved your patrons are
          and how much your employees like their job. In the context of a city, a higher morale score would represent
          a lower crime rate, bustling businesses, and overall happier citizens.</p>

        <p><strong>Order</strong> represents the efficiency and organization of your Establishment. This can be
          interpreted as how well the pieces of your Establishment work together. In the context of a tavern, a higher
          Order score would represent an efficient serving team and a good system to keep your merchandise sorted and
          accounted for. In the context of a city, a higher Order score would mean deep traditions, respected
          officials, and an efficient political system.</p>

        <p><strong>Wealth</strong> represents the amount of resources and money your Establishment has. This can be
          interpreted as your level of money, financial stability, and mercantile opportunities. In the context of a
          tavern, a higher Wealth score would represent higher income, access to unique merchandise, or connections to
          buy goods at a discount. In the context of a city, a higher Wealth score would represent access to mineral
          deposits, good trade deals, or a higher output of goods.</p>

        <p>These 6 stats are the core of Establishments. As players make decisions through their roleplay, the Game
          Master will decide how their player's decisions would affect their Establishment's stats and adjust them
          accordingly. The GM has no obligation to let their player know which stats are being changed unless the
          player asks, and the Game Master should only let their player know how their stats are doing through the
          narrative of the game.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="power">
        <h2>Power</h2>
        <p>Each stat level corresponds with both a narrative word and a set number (i.e., Moderate is 3 and Exquisite is
          10). Your Power is the sum of all 6 of your stats and is a block number to give you a good idea on how your
          Establishment is doing overall. So, if I had all my establishment stats at Moderate, than my power would be
          18. Any rival Establishments will also have a Power score.</p>

        <p>The Power score is mainly used to compare your Establishment with others. The Establishment with the highest
          power score is in control. Being in control means that your Establishment is the top in the area. Being in
          control allows you to attempt to grow the size of your Establishment by absorbing your competitors.</p>

        <h2>Establishment Size</h2>
        <p>Any Establishment that would be bigger than your Establishment would have control over you. For example, the
          city that your Establishment is in can create laws that directly affect your Establishment.</p>

        <p>On the Establishment Sheet, there is a small field for your Establishment's size. This is just a simple word
          that lets you understand the scope of your Establishment. Some examples of sizes would be city, village,
          tavern, gang, guild, etc. and for most Establishments this size will never change. However, a few
          Establishments will dream bigger. They'll want to grow their size to gain more and more power.</p>

        <p>In order to grow your Establishment size, you'll need to first be in control by having the highest power
          score. Then, you'll need to decide if growing your Establishment means absorbing your competitors or
          toppling them.</p>

        <p>For business-like Establishments, you'll want to absorb your competitors, which would be Establishments of
          your same size. To absorb competitors, you'll need to roleplay any plans that you have buy out your
          competition. If this is successful, you'll have to average your stats with their stats. So, if you have
          Exquisite (10) Wealth, but they only have Poor (1) Wealth, then your new Wealth score will be Good (5). When
          the average number doesn't settle on a specific stat level, just pick to go up or go down.</p>

        <p>For rebellion-like Establishments, you'll want to topple your competitor, which will be a bigger size
          Establishment than you. For this, you'll need heavy amounts of roleplay. You'll need to make plans to hurt
          specific stats of the Establishment you're trying to take down. Then make plans to depose and usurp them to
          take over their position. But be careful. When you topple an Establishment, you take over their exact stats.
          So, if you had a Great in Innovation, but you caused your target to drop down to Poor Innovation, then when
          you take control, your Innovation will drop to Poor.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="starting-an-establishment">
        <h2>Starting an Establishment</h2>
        <p>When players start an establishment, quickly grab an establishment sheet, and fill it out with whatever makes
          sense. If it seems they should start with all their stats at good, then do so.</p>

        <p>Be sure to roleplay how you get there.</p>

        <p>Also, if it seems like the players are outing most of their energy into their Establishment, then this
          becomes the focus mechanic, instead of something in the background.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="growing-your-establishment">
        <h2>Growing Your Establishment</h2>
        <p>You can grow your Establishments by simply roleplaying. Make decisions, find ways to do what you want, and
          your actions will alter your stats and Establishment size. Keep in mind that what you do can affect multiple
          stats; it might raise some stats and lower others. And of course, some things will happen that are
          completely out of your control.</p>

        <p>Whenever you want to consciously increase a stat, you may roleplay how you want to make that happen and then
          roll a lead skill check to see how well you did. Failing this skill check can cause the stat to go down
          instead.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="events-and-competitors">
        <h2>Events & Competitors</h2>
        <p>Events are happening around your Establishment all the time, and they will affect your Establishment. At any
          time, the Game Master may have an event happen to your Establishment. Events can be good or bad and they can
          impact your stats and party size in a variety of ways. For example, a famine is almost guaranteed to lower
          your Health score.</p>

        <p>Then, of course, there are other Establishments. Periodically, they may try to affect your stats or even
          crush you completely. All of which is up to the Game Master to decide.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="keeping-track-of-other-establishments">
        <h2>Keeping Track of Other Establishments</h2>
        <p>For convenience, we made it so that you can keep track of 4 Establishments on one Establishment sheet. This
          way, you can keep track of up to 3 other Establishments. Only keep track of ones that players will actually
          be interacting with. Otherwise, it's a waste of energy on your part.</p>

        <p>As players interact with other Establishments, be sure to let the stats of the NPC Establishment fluctuate.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="war">
        <h2>War</h2>
        <h3>Preparing for War</h3>
        <p>When in Control or struggling to gain Control, you may find yourself in need of a war. If so, here is a way
          to go about preparing, and then waging, war.</p>

        <p>The first thing you need to do is establish your troops. If you're currently preparing for war, you'll need
          to roleplay your Establishment as you build your army. Increase you Might score as much as possible, and
          when you're ready, figure out how many troops you have.</p>

        <p>If the war wasn't necessarily planned, then you might find that you haven't needed to know your troop count
          until now.</p>

        <p>To find your troop count, multiply the number of your Might stat with the size of your Establishment. Look at
          the following chart and use whatever size seems closest to your establishment.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th colspan='2'>Size Multiplier</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class='bottom left alignLeft'>Village</td>
              <td class='bottom right alignRight'>x10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class='bottom left alignLeft'>Town</td>
              <td class='bottom right alignRight'>x100</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class='bottom left alignLeft'>City</td>
              <td class='bottom right alignRight'>x1,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class='bottom left alignLeft'>Country</td>
              <td class='bottom right alignRight'>x10,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class='bottom left alignLeft'>Emppire</td>
              <td class='bottom right alignRight'>x100,000</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>So, if I have a Might stat of Great (8) and my Establishment is roughly the size of city (x1,000), then my
          troop count would be 8,0000</p>

        <p>You can also decrease your Wealth stat to increase your Might stat. This can represent buying technologically
          superior weapons, training more troops, etc.</p>

        <p>Once you have your troop count established, you're ready to start waging war.</p>

        <h3>Waging War</h3>
        <p>Waging war is very similar to combat between two people. In war, you take actions, and your opponent reacts,
          then vice versa. Except in war, it's on a much larger scale and takes time.</p>

        <p>When you attack, you choose how to attack and roll an opposed <em>lead</em> skill check against the opponents
          <em>lead</em> skill check. The loser takes 50% of the enemies' troop count as a troop loss to the troops
          they were defending with. So, if I attack with 8,000 troops and my enemy defends with 8,000 troops and I win
          the dice roll, then the enemy will take 50% of my troop count as damage. 50% of 8,000 is 4,000, so the
          enemy's troops will drop by 4,000, bringing it down to 4,000.
        </p>

        <p>Remember that you can do a lot more than just simply attack with your troops: you're still an Establishment
          after all. You can go on the defensive and only react to attacks, making any allies you have more likely to
          help your troops out. You can parley with the enemy leaders to make peace treaties. Or you can lay siege to
          the enemy and cut off their supplies. The more creative you get, the better.</p>

        <h3>Avoiding Troop Loss</h3>
        <p>If you find yourself in a situation where you're not very confident in winning the opposed skill check,
          consider taking an evasive action instead of attacking. This generally means some sort of retreat. When you
          do this, you are guaranteed to lose the dice check, but you'll only take half the troop loss. So, if you
          were going to take 4,000 troop losses, then you would only lose 2,000 instead.</p>

        <h3>More Than the Fight</h3>
        <p>It's important to remember that there's a lot more to war than the actual battles. As you command troops, you
          should have breaks between attacks where you are role-playing your Establishment.</p>

        <p>As you make actions in your Establishment, you can make them war oriented, and the GM should give you bonuses
          in war for the decisions you make. This can be +1 or +2 to your dice roll, giving the enemy disadvantage, or
          adding to your troop counts.</p>
