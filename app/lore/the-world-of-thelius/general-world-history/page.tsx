        <h1>General World History of Thelius</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The world of Thelius has a long history, but a vast majority of it has been lost to time due to a horrific and prolonged event known as Starfall. About 700 years ago, Thelius was in it's renaissance. The world was full of new expressions of art, science, philosophy, and more. Cultures were shifting and the world was making steady progress towards an enlightenment period and an industrial revolution. The various sentient species of Thelius mingled and coexisted, some more peacefully than others, but each knew of the others and relationships were built.</p>

        <p>However, the overall prosperity didn't last. See, the stars in Thelius' sky are stagnant and unmoving, but for some reason unknown to the people of Thelius a star simply fell from the heavens one day. When it impacted the ground, it devastated the area around it for miles, ripping up the ground and vaporizing even the very stone that was nearby. The worst of it, however, was the fallout. The plume of debris and smoke that emanated from Starfall Crater was different than it should have been. Rather than toxic gasses and a cloud so big that it would blot out the sun for weeks or even months, the cloud took a more condensed form and glowed with a light blue light.</p>

        <p>This cloud, known as the Star Storm, moved across the land and everywhere it touched, chaos would unfold. Everything it touched would warp and waver and reality would change. The rules that governed the universe would cease to hold sway where ever the storm found purchase. Entire civilizations were wiped off the face of the world in a matter of months.</p>

        <p>After a few desperate years of this horrific storm sweeping around the land, new creatures appeared. These Mythic creatures appeared to have been born of the Star Storm because they fed and thrived off of its energy. New plants, herbivores, and predators created an entire ecosystem around the energy of the Storm that began to thrive. Their population exploded rapidly, and as they fed off the energy of the storm, it got smaller, and smaller.</p>

        {/* <p>However, the overall prosperity didn't last. It started as a few ordinary creatures, generally predators, exhibiting strange powers; manipulation of the elements. And with their new powers, these few creatures also became ravenous, willing to eat anything made of meat - people included. At first, it was mostly seen as a few frightening cases. Odd but not overall worrisome. Nonetheless, people became much more frightened of wild animals, but no real panic was created. However, over the course of about 20 years, the aggressiveness of these creatures spread completely throughout their own species and the amount of Mythical creatures in the world increased dramatically. Entire towns began to be attacked and were destroyed. People fled to large cities in the hope of protection against the threat of these mythical creatures, but even cities began to fall. People soon found that when attacked head on, these new Mythical creatures could explode violently when attacked, and no one knew why. No one could fight them and live. The few that tried ended up causing massive explosions that tore the earth apart as they accidentally broke the Navidus crystals that every Mythical animal has since no one at the time knew about them.</p>

        <p>With city after city being toppled by Mythical animals, mass panic, and a lack of resources, nations began to collapse. So, hundreds of expeditionary groups were sent out to try and find new places to live that either had no Mythical creatures or at least had strong enough natural protections to give them the advantage they needed to survive. Almost all the groups failed, but six of them managed to find a place that provided some safety from the mythical creatures. These six cities became the Ancestor City-States: Aquina, Arbor, Corden, Inidom, Kulasis, and Galus.</p> */}

        <p>And that's how the world found itself, and it stayed that way for about 500 years. During this time, each of the Ancestor City-States rebuilt their culture, discovered new ways of defending themselves from their hostile environments, and more-or-less prospered. These cities were inhabited by only one species each and over time the knowledge of the other species faded into legend. Nearly all documentation of the time before the Mythic Crisis was lost except for a few maps and books, and for each of the species the world became very, very small. Then, the airship was invented.</p>

        <p>Around 500 years after the founding of the Ancestor City-States, the first airship was constructed in Kulasis, the desert city of the Slated, and the world began to be explored again. The Slated were desperate to escape their desert city, since the environment there was incredibly unforgiving. Some of the biggest Mythical creatures burrow beneath the sands, sandstorms are frequent and intense, and food is very difficult to grow. The Slated's entire culture was built around progress and innovation with the goal of finding a new home. With airships at their disposal, they found one.</p>

        <p>At the center of a large area of meadows, grass, and meandering streams rises a singular and great plateau, and it was here that the Slated founded their new city: Avidal, the City of Progress. Over the course of the next 50 years, they constructed their new home, continued exploring the world, and never lost their sense of innovation. Over time, they re-discovered the other sentient species of the world and invited them to help in the construction of Avidal, to make it a hub of ideas, cultures, and inclusion.</p>

        <p>The world got bigger as new methods of communication were invented such as long distance radio. Airships allowed for trade and transportation to the various Ancestor City-States. It also became apparent that the mythical creature population had lessened enough to create small settlements throughout the land. Guilds became a standard business practice for groups of skilled workers to join together to create a larger business. And for 50 more years, the world grew and prospered.</p>

        <p>As the world currently stands, industry and engineering is picking up. Mythical creatures are being studied and understood. The great Mythologist, Heinris Navidus discovered ways to utilize the power of Mythical creatures as an energy source. The drug known as Myth is growing in popularity even though it is a crime to use or possess it. Centrifuge Technology is just beginning to emerge. And there is still so much wilderness to be explored, and so much knowledge about the times before the Mythic Crisis to be discovered.</p>

        <h2>The World Before</h2>
        <p>The various cultures and religions of Thelius hold a wide variety of beliefs about the times before the Mythic Crisis, but none of them have the whole picture and most of them have lost so much history. What history they have managed to hold on to has become greatly misconstrued with legends and mystery. While each culture and religion has their own ideas of the times before the Mythic Crisis, the following is an accurate account.</p>

        <p>Before the Mythic Crisis, the world was much like our own world during its Renaissance Era. It was a major time of change for art, philosophy, political theory, economics and more. The continent was generally explored and maps had been made. The sophonts of Thelius mingled and warred, and the known world was slowly approaching a modern era.</p>

        <p>During this time, mythical creatures didn't exist and magic took the form of simple parlor tricks and sleight of hand. Dragons were novelty creatures that were no bigger than a dog in size and the various sophonts were at the top of the food chain. They had very little to worry about other than the problems that they made for themselves.</p>

        {/* 
        - Navidus energy originates from one very specific plant in one very specific place
        - Normally these plants are only eaten by dragons (the original, singular mythical creature )
          - Dragons are migratory, small animals that only eat this one plant
        - Displaced prey species ate these plants and become unnatural mythic creatures
          - Mythic creatures must eat to maintain their body or the navidus crystal out-paces their body and kills them */}
