  {/* - Before the mythic crisis, the world was at it's renaissance period
      - Most of the Species had made contact with each other by this time
      - The world was widely settled with many cities, villages, etc.
      - For most cultures, the history of this time period is fairly unknown due to the chaos of the Mythic Crisis
      - The mythic crisis threw the world back hundreds of years in all areas of knowledge (tech, health, culture, etc)
      - During the crisis, most people fled to cities, and overtime, as they realized their cities would not last, expeditionary groups were set out to find places with natural protections that they could survive in.
        - This is how the Ancestor City-States were founded
        - The successful city-states (of which, there are only the 6) were built in locations where a species specific adaptations were most advantageous.
        - Because of this, over the first 100 years of building these cities, the bio-diversity of the population dropped completely until only 1 species was left.
      - It's been about 500 years (10-15 generations) since the foundings of the Ancestor City-States, and knowledge of the other species has become legend
      - Approx. 500 years after the original foundings of the city-states, the airship was invented in Kulasis, city of the Slated, allowing open and moderately safe exploration of the world once again.
      - Over the next 50 years, the Slated began founding Avidal, City of Progress and as they rediscovered the other sentient species, they invited them to Avidal to create a hub of culture, science, and industry
      - The current time period is another 50 years past this. So Avidal is now 100 years old, all the other ancestor cities are roughly 600 years old.
        - Knowledge of the time before the crisis has been collected from the various species and they have a spotty understanding of the time before.
        - Understanding of mythical biology, Navidus energy, and centrifuge technology is currently emerging as modern science along side the study of steam power, electricity, mechanics, and industry.

        <h1>General World History of Thelius</h1>

        <p>The world of Thelius has a long history, but a vast majority of it has been lost to time due to a horrific and prolonged event known as The Mythic Crisis. About 700 years ago, Thelius was in it's renaissance. The world was full of new expressions of art, science, and philosophy. Cultures were shifting and the world was making steady progress towards an enlightenment period and an industrial revolution. The various sentient species of Thelius mingled and coexisted, some more peacefully than others, but each knew of the others and relationships were built.</p>

        <p>However, the overall prosperity didn't last. It started as a few ordinary creatures, generally predators, exhibiting strange powers and aggressive behaviors. At first, it was only seen as odd. People became wary of wild animals, but no real panic was created. However, over the course of about 20 years, the populations of these creatures grew exponentially. Entire towns began to be attacked and were destroyed. People fled to large cities in the hope of protection against the threat of these mythical creatures, but even cities began to fall. No one could fight them and live. The few that tried ended up causing massive explosions that tore the earth apart as they accidentaly broke the Navidus crystals that every Mythical animal has, but now one really knew about.</p>

        <p>As city after city began to be toppled from Mythical animals, mass panic, and a lack of resources, nations began to collapse. So, hundreds of expeditionary groups were sent out to try and find new places to live that either had no Mythical creatures or at least had strong enough natural protections to give them the advantage they needed to survive. Almost all the groups failed, but six of them managed to find a place that provided some safety from the mythical creatures. These six cities became the Ancestor City-States: Aquina, Arbor, Corden, Inidom, Kulasis, and Galus.</p>

        <p>And that's how the world found itself, and it stayed that way for about 500 years. During this time, each of the Ancestor City-States rebuilt their culture, discovered new ways of defending themselves from their hostile environments, and more-or-less prospered. These cities were inhabited by only one species each and over time the knowledge of the other species faded into legend. Nearly all documentation of the time before the Mythic Crisis was lost except for a few maps and books, and for each of the species the world became very, very small. Then, the airship was invented.</p>

        <p>Around 500 years after the founding of the Ancestor City-States, the first airship was constructed in Kulasis, the desert city of the Slated, and the world began to be explored again. The Slated were desperate to escape their desert city, since the environment there was far harsher than anywhere else. Some of the biggest Mythical creatures burrow beneath the sands, sandstorms are frequent and intense, a food is very difficult to grow. The Slated's entire culture was built around progress and innovation with the goal of finding a new home. With airships at their disposal, they found one.</p>

        <p>At the center of a large area of meadows, grass, and meandering streams rises a singular and great plateau, and it was here that the Slated founded their new city: Avidal, the City of Progress. Over the course of the next 50 years, they constructed their new home, continued exploring the world, and never lost their sense of innovation. Over time, they re-discovered the other sentient species of the world and invited them to help in the construction of Avidal, to make it a hub of ideas, cultures, and inclusion.</p>

        <p>The world got bigger as new methods of communication were invented such as long distance radio. Airships allowed for trade and transportation to the various Ancestor City-States. It also became apparent that the mythical creature population had lessened enough to create small settlements throughout the land. Guilds became a standard business practice for groups of skilled workers to join together to create a larger business. And for 50 more years, the world grew and prospered.</p>

        <p>As the world currently stands, industry and engineering is picking up. Mythical creatures are being studied well and understood. The great Mythologist, Heinris Navidus discovered ways to utilize the power of Mythical creatures as an energy source. The drug known as Myth is growing in popularity even though it is a crime to use or possess it. Centrifuge Technology is just beginning to emerge. And there is still so much wilderness to be explored, and so much knowledge about the times before the Mythic Crisis to be discovered.</p>
