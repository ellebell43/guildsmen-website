        {/* === NOTES === 
        - Centrifuge tech is an emerging technology pioneered by Jax Aquin and is a new tool designed to fight back against Mythical creatures using their own powers
        - It works by swirling raw mythic blood around a navidus crystal (mimicking Mythical biology) to create an effect
          - Mythical creatures perform magic by charging special particles/compounds that saturate their blood.
            - When feeling threatened or needing to hunt, a Mythical creature can cause its blood to swirl around their Navidus Crystal, charging their blood.
            - Once charged, this blood travels to a specialized organ that controls the influx of power and channels it into something useful for the creature
            - Once in the organ, the energy stored in the blood is released, and the shape of the particle/compound determines what the energy turns into (i.e., fire, ice, water, tectonic vibrations, etc.)
          - Centrifuge weapons mimic this by sending raw blood through a tube (activated via trigger) that swirls around a suspended Navidus Crystal. This activates the blood, then at the end of the barrel, the blood is shot out. On contact with the air, the blood activates, becoming some element or energy depending on the type of blood used.
            - The tubes of the weapon are lined on the inside with a substance that lines the inside of Mythical creature blood vessels. This is what inhibits the energy from transforming until it leaves the body (or barrel, in case of these weapons)
          - Mythic blood + no inhibitor = magic
