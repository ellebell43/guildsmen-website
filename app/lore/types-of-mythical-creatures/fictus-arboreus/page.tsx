        <h1>Fictus Arboreus (Hunting Tree)</h1>
        <p>The Fictus Arboreus, commonly known as a Hunting Tree, is the only known Mythical plant. Unlike Mythical animals, it has no inherent magical abilities due to its fundamentally different physiology and lack of need for a magical defensive system. The Navidus Crystal is located beneath the main trunk of the plant in a thick cocoon of roots. The Crystal is used to provide its energy instead of photosynthesis, while it eats other creatures to provide itself with materials for growth and reproduction.</p>

        <p>This plant-based Mythical creature is carnivorous. Its main body is wide and goblet shaped with a cap on top, and at first glance appears to have no other appendages attached to it. However, the main purpose of this plant's root system is not to absorb nutrients from the ground, but to hide its very motile arms. Spreading out from the Navidus root-cocoon is a great many vines that travel under the ground. When they encounter a larger root system from an actual tree, some of these vines then grow upward, acting much like creeper vines as they wrap around the other plant. These particular vines are known as sentinels. They are the eyes of the tree. Each vine has at least one organ that seems to be able to see heat. The Hunting Tree uses this to find its prey.</p>

        <p>The other vines come out of the ground some distance from the tree and grow along the ground, just below the top layer of soil. When a sentinel vine targets a prey, these other vines, known as striking vines, lash out, wrapping around the victim and bringing them to the main part of the plant. These striking vines are covered in small barbs that allow them to latch onto the victim and make it extremely painful and deadly to be let go of the vine.</p>

        <p>The main part of the plant appears to be a thick jungle tree. It grows very tall and near other trees. It doesn’t have any branches itself, but grows close enough to other trees to make it less noticeable.</p>
        {/* ⦁	It’s a carnivorous jungle plant with creeper vine-like tentacles coming up from the root system
            ⦁	The vines are thick, long tentacles that mimic common jungle creeper vines
            ⦁	Each vine has at least one heat sensing organ to detect prey
            ⦁	When a tentacle notices a heat signature, it lashes out, wraps around the prey, and drops it into the main body
            ⦁	The main body is a large, goblet-shaped bulb filled with extremely patent stomach acid with a moveable cap to seal the bulb
            ⦁	The Navidus crystal is contained beneath the plant, wrapped in a thick cocoon of roots
            ⦁	The plant reproduces via offshoots from the main root system
            ⦁	It has no inherent magical abilities due to it being a plant. The biology is very different from animals
            ⦁	Could potentially be used to “garden” Navidus Crystals
            ⦁	Its main body has a defense mechanism that releases poisonous gas if something gets too close
            ⦁	The vines have barbs that act like fishing hooks
